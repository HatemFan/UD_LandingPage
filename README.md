# Landing Page Project

## OverVirew

This project is done for Udacity Nanodegree Program for front end development.

I had cloned HTML & CSS File, and I had develop Javascript Code on my own.

## What are the steps I follow ?

First I read the rubric file.

Then I walk throug the code to understand what I need.

Then I search for the new properties and methods to know how to use them.

Then I refactor the code, by reviewing it.

Finally I make sure it's working correctly and I use ESLINT to factor it.

## Structure of JS code

Js code contains three main parts.

1- Creation of Dynamic NavBar depending on sections on the page.

2- Make the navbar clickable and when choose one section, and move the page to this section

3- Get the section appears on the screen to the users. and change active classes for the section to change the background and change navbar element
